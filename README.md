# TDD-Java-Yu-Gi-Oh

Test-Driven Development (TDD) using JUnit for testing, and refactoring using the built-in tools of Visual Studio Code along with SonarQube to verify code quality.

The application is based on the Yu-Gi-Oh card game, where each card has a specific attack, defense, effect, and position.

It begins with simple initial tests, and complexity is gradually increased, modifying the code as needed and refactoring along the way.
